              I would like to extend a warm welcome to all of the teams
              participating in this year's championship. As we come together to
              compete, let us not forget the true spirit of championship. While
              winning is certainly important, it is equally important to respect
              our fellow competitors and to show support and encouragement to
              all teams throughout the championship. I encourage you all to give
              your best effort and to play fair at all times. Remember, the way
              we conduct ourselves on the field is a reflection of our character
              as individuals and as a department.
            </p>
